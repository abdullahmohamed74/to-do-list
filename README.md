# Grocery-bud app

to do list, using react

## Steps

the flow of the application should look something like this:

- In App.jsx, set up a state variable called items using the useState hook.
- Create a Form component that contains an input field and a submit button, and set up the handleSubmit function to add new items to the list.
- Create two new components: Items and SingleItem, and use them to render the list of items.
- Set up local storage functionality to persist the list of items across page reloads.
- Implement the react-toastify library to handle alerts when a new item is added to the list, when the user tries to submit an empty form, and when an item is removed from the list.
